Accompaniment to Medium article Making Your Loss FunctionÂ Count, demonstrating how to use a custom loss function in 
TensorFlow.


# Pre-requisites

### pipenv

In order to run the notebook [Custom_Tensorflow_Loss_Function](Custom_Tensorflow_Loss_Function.ipynb), you will need
to install all of the python libraries used in advance.

I find it easiest to use pipenv so that you have a self-contained environment for executing this code.

If you do not already have pipenv, follow the instructions [here](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/).


### Creating virtual environment and running notebook

Once pipenv is installed, you can create your virtual environment and install of the dependencies by executing the 
command below:

```sh
pipenv sync
```

Finally, fire up the Jupyter Notebook within the new virtual environment using this command:

```sh
pipenv run jupyter notebook
```
